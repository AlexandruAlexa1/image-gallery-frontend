Set API URL in `environment.ts`:

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api/images'
};
```

> In production, update `environment.prod.ts` with your Elastic Beanstalk backend URL.

npm install
ng serve
```

Visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to run locally.

- Updates gallery immediately after each upload.  
- Deployed on **AWS S3 + CloudFront** for high availability and global access.  
- Backend hosted on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, using **RDS MySQL** and **S3**.
